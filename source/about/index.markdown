Blog of MOD(model organism database) software developers <a
href="cybersiddhu.github.com">Siddhartha Basu</a> and Yogesh Pandit.
It is about the kind of software developmental hurdles we have crossed and those 
for which we don't have an answer, good ideas and solution that come out of user questions 
and anything that comes in between.
